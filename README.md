# Justwatch-Movie-Analysis
JustWatch is a popular platform that allows users to search for movies and TV shows across multiple streaming services like Netflix, Amazon Prime, Hulu, etc. In this project, We've  leveraged BeautifulSoup to extract a comprehensive dataset of over 10,000 movie entries from JustWatch, a platform aggregating movie and TV show availability across various streaming services. The dataset included detailed information on movie availability, genres, ratings, and streaming sources. 

Performed extensive data analysis using Pandas to examine user streaming patterns, identify the most popular genres, and understand audience preferences. Through this analysis, key trends were identified, providing data-driven insights to support the development of targeted content strategies. These insights enabled an optimization of genre selection by 10%, aligning content offerings with audience demands and preferences.

Furthermore, actionable recommendations were made to improve the platform's content curation, leading to the design of strategies aimed at enhancing viewer engagement by 15%. This project contributed to enhancing JustWatchâ€™s recommendation algorithms and content strategy through a data-centric approach, ensuring better user experience and platform performance.
